2fa is a TOTP server pivoted from rsc/2fa(cli based 2fa client)

frustrated with other either "incompatible" or "over-engineered" 2fa-totp packages,
porting TOTP generation code from rsc/2fa to implement server side works like charm



## IT's a WIP!
- works fine on generating totp url.

### To-Do
- totp validation
- retry throttling 
- can be more beautifull !
